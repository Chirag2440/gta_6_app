# GTA VI - Web Animation Concepts

  A creative exploration of advanced web animations inspired by the aesthetic of Grand Theft Auto VI. This project was built to showcase complex frontend visual effects and push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies. The primary focus is on creating an immersive, cinematic animation experience for desktop users.

This is a non-responsive animation showcase and is not a functional website. It is intended for viewing on desktop screens for the optimal experience.



## Features

- Cinematic Intro Sequence: An engaging loading animation powered by a GSAP timeline.

- Smooth Scene Transitions: Seamless animations between different visual concepts and scenes.

- Interactive UI Elements: Hover effects and micro-interactions that enhance the visual showcase.

- Dynamic Backgrounds: Integration of video and animated elements to create a rich, dynamic atmosphere.
